# 01-Hello-Class
Hi! In this program, I tell a little about myself by using python. 

The program should read:

Hello, Class!
My name is Kayla.
I love to game, but I haven't done so in a while.
My usual go to games are Skyrim, Sims, and Guitar Hero.
I'm excited to get to learn a new programming language, and I'm excited to begin creating my own content.
Although the class seems like it is going to be really fun, I'm afraid that I won't be good at coding or that I'll be drowning in work.
The URL to my github profile is https://github.com/Barnes31.
And my Stack Overflow user number is 8497239.
